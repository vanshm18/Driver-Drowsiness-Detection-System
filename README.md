# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a real-time application that monitors a driver's eye movements to determine their alertness level. Using Python and libraries like OpenCV, Dlib, NumPy, Facemutils, and Pygame, the system detects facial landmarks, calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), and classifies the driverâ€™s state as Active, Drowsy, or Sleepy. If the EAR falls below a predefined threshold for a continuous period, an alert sound is triggered using Pygame to prevent potential accidents. This system provides an efficient, non-intrusive solution to enhance road safety by reducing drowsy driving risks.
